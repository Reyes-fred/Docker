# Docker
This github have the propose to share some DockerFiles to reproduce previouse application (opencv, tensorflow, machinelearning, nodejs, etc), with the propose to simplify all the installation process by executing a single command to build this docker and play with it. Also this will help us to understand more
about Docker and Orchestation with the use of Swarm and Kubernetes. 
Each dockerfile contains a txt that show how to run the file, or you can execute the sh file.
